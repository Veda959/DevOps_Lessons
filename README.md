# AWS EC2 API 
What is Automation ? - It is a Scripted format of what we do manually, it is more useful when we have more number of a task to do.
When we need to create hundred of EC2 Instances, the better way to do it is automate through script.
Every service in the AWS have its own API, basically API's are "Request and Response" structures. The main components to be checked are:
1. Validation - Whether the API request is valid or not
2. Authentication - Whether the request API has access to the AWS console or not.?
3. Authorization - Wheteher the requested API is authorized to do that particular task or service to do anything (Like creating EC2 instances, the person should have access to the EC2 service).
